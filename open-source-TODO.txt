Things to do before we open source this.

* Stop using active_support/core_ext (forces them on users)
* Remove the not-very-general use-case-specific declarations (redis_url,
  api_credential), e.g. move them back into rapportive_ruby
* Improve summary and description in gemspec
* Improve rubydocs
* blog post
* README
