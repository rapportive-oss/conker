Things to do.

* Add a "required" declaration (required in all environments)
* Consider rejecting unexpected keys (i.e. typo-checking) for the hash case
* Make the API less weird (shouldn't have to reopen the Conker module to use it)
* Support namespaces (e.g. MyModule::NUM_WIDGETS vs ::NUM_WIDGETS)
